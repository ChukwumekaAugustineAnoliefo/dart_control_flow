Dart Control Flow Examples

This repository contains examples showcasing the control flow structures in Dart. These examples provide clear, commented code to help developers understand how to manage the flow of their programs effectively. From conditional statements to loops and ternary operators, each example is designed to demonstrate specific concepts in Dart programming.

Examples Included

If-Else Statement: Demonstrates basic conditional branching.

Switch-Case Statement: Shows how to use switch cases for multiple conditions.

For Loop: Explains iteration using a for loop.

While Loop: Demonstrates a condition-based loop.

Do-While Loop: Explains post-condition looping.

Break and Continue: Illustrates how to exit or skip iterations in loops.

Nested Loops: Shows looping within loops for multi-dimensional iterations.

Ternary Operator: Demonstrates concise conditional assignments.
